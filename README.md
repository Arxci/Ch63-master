# CHESS AI

This Project is an AI made using native Javascript. The AI uses the minimax alogrithm with alpha beta pruning to quickly and accurately predict the best moves

# What I Learned

* How to create a fast and performant AI from scratch
* Initializing a board by using a FEN string
* How to include moves such as en passant and castling
* Store moves as bits 

# Difficulties Experienced

* Struggled finding a performant, but also accurate method of determing moves

Usage
------------
